Enable additional post processing effects such as bloom, lensflare, different aa options and motion blur.

[h1] Bloom and lensflare [/h1]

Can be fully controlled with the ingame UI with the following settings:

    - bloomIntensity: The intensity of the bloom effect.
    - bloomThreshhold: Lower means bloom occurs with lower light intensity.
    - bloomSpread: The amount that the bloom is blurred.
    - bloomBlurIteration: Higher iterations cause a more smoothed blur.
    - lensflareIntensity: The intensity of the lensflare effect.
    - lensflareThreshhold: Lower means that less bloom is needed to create lensflare.
    - lensFlareSaturation: Higher saturation makes the lensflare more like the light color.
    - lensflareRotation: In which rotation the lensflare expands.
    - lensflareWidth: The width of the lensflare effect.
    - lensflareBlurIterations: Higher iterations cause a more smoothed lens flare ends.
    - Enable ghosting lensflare: Causes camera ghosting effects to appear from bright light sources.
    
[h1] Anti Aliasing [/h1]

Supports FXAA, SMAA and TAA.

    - FXAA is Fast Approximate Anti Aliasing.
        - Five presets ranging from very low to ultra.

    - SMAA is Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Antialiasing 
        - Four presets ranging from low to ultra.
        - Enable Temporal: Enables SMAA T2x, this samples over two frames and has a slight performance impact.

Not as effective as the DynamicResolution mod by nlight, but cheaper and can be combined if desired. 

[h1] Screen Space Ambient Occlusion [/h1]

This is different implementation then the SSAO mod by Ulysius, so chose one depending on preference.

    - Intensity: How much the surfaces are darkened.
    - Radius: Controls the spread of the occlusion.
    - Sample Count: The amount of samples taken around each pixel, impacts performance.
    - Occlusion: Either depth or depth + normal is used, looks slightly different.
    - Enable Downsampling: Only sample at half resolution, impacts performance.
    
[h1] Additional Information [/h1]

All effects can be disabled so they don't have any performance impact. An ingame UI is provided to tweak the options and can be toggled with F9 (default), the toggle key can be changed in UI.[url=http://pastebin.com/qe5BwdA2]Here[/url] is a list of possible keycodes, fill in the string and not the corresponding number.
